1. Initialize Logging
The script logs all activities to C:\Users\Public\stealth_log.txt using log_message().
It records detected drives, copied files, and upload statuses.
2. Detect External Drives
The script checks connected drives using psutil.disk_partitions().
It identifies removable drives and keeps track of newly inserted or removed ones.
3. Monitor Drives for a Specific Folder ("lol")
When a new drive is detected, it checks if the "lol" folder exists.
If found, it:
Creates C:\Users\Public\copied_lol if not already present.
Copies all files and folders from "lol" into this local directory.
4. Log Drive Contents
The script lists all files and folders in the external drive.
It saves this log to stealth_log.txt.
5. Detect Drive Removal
When a drive is unplugged, it logs the event and uploads:
stealth_log.txt
The copied "lol" folder (as a .zip file)
6. Upload Files to Uploadcare
The script uses requests.post() to send the files to Uploadcare.
If the upload is successful, it logs the file ID.
If it fails, the error is logged.
7. Cleanup Process
After uploading, it deletes:
The local copy of the "lol" folder.
The created .zip file.
The stealth_log.txt.
This ensures no traces remain on the system.
8. Continuous Monitoring
The script runs inside an infinite loop, checking for new drives every 5 seconds.
This ensures it can detect any USB inserted at any time.
