i cloned the TIP git in my local computer nad then  tried to make a docker file 
                                              
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire project
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js project with standalone output
RUN npm run build

# Change working directory to the standalone output
WORKDIR /app/.next/standalone

# Copy .next/static separately (Next.js requires it)
COPY --from=0 /app/.next/static /app/.next/static

# Expose the port Next.js runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the Next.js standalone server
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
